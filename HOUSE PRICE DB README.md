**HOUSE PRICE FORECASTING DASHBOARD, breaking down the key metrics and what they reveal about the dataset:**
________________________________________
**Area by Parking**
•	Parking availability strongly influences property counts. 
o	Properties with 0 parking spaces dominate (299 + 100 = 399 units).
o	Only 126 units have 1 parking space, and very few have 2 or 3.
•	Insight: Most houses in this dataset are sold without dedicated parking. This could indicate urban density or lower-end housing stock.
________________________________________
**Price by Bathrooms**
•	Bathroom count is a major driver of price distribution. 
o	Houses with 2 bathrooms account for 73.58% of the dataset.
o	Houses with 1 bathroom are much fewer (24.4%).
o	Very few houses have 3 or 4 bathrooms.
•	Insight: The market is heavily skewed toward 2-bathroom homes, which likely represent the standard family unit.
________________________________________
**Price by Bedrooms**
•	Bedroom distribution shows clustering around 2–4 bedrooms.
•	The dashboard also links bedrooms with air conditioning: 
o	373 homes (68.44%) have air conditioning.
o	172 homes (31.56%) do not.
•	Insight: Air conditioning is a common feature, but not universal. Larger homes (4–6 bedrooms) are more likely to have AC.
________________________________________
**Area with Basement**
•	65.2% of homes have basements.
•	Insight: Basements are a significant feature, possibly tied to larger plot sizes or higher-end homes.
________________________________________
**Bathrooms by Furnishing**
•	Furnishing levels are fairly balanced: 
o	Semi-furnished: 296 homes
o	Unfurnished: 212 homes
o	Furnished: 193 homes
•	Insight: Buyers are split between preferring ready-to-move-in homes and customizing themselves. Semi-furnished is the most common option.
________________________________________
**Overall Observations**
•	Dominant profile of a typical house sold: 
o	2 bathrooms, 2–4 bedrooms, semi-furnished, with air conditioning, and often a basement.
•	Parking scarcity stands out as the biggest limitation in the dataset.
•	Air conditioning and furnishing are differentiators that may influence price premiums.
